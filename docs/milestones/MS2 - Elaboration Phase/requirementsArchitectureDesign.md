# BotBlocker Elaboration Phase: Requirements, Architecture, and Design

## State of the Art

### 1. The Problem

Social networks face a growing threat from malicious bots, which manipulate interactions, spread misinformation, and influence politics and economies. Studies show 9-15% of active Twitter/X users are bots, with 8.5% confirmed as automated. As bots become more sophisticated with AI, detecting them is increasingly challenging, threatening the authenticity of online spaces.

### 2. Impact of Bots

Bots distort public opinion, interfere in elections, and manipulate financial markets. For example, during the 2016 U.S. elections, 20% of Twitter interactions were bot-generated. They also pose cybersecurity risks, such as identity theft and phishing, by cloning real profiles or infiltrating organizations. Their ability to mimic human behavior makes them a persistent threat.

### 3. Our Solution: Bot Blocker

Bot Blocker combines AI, community participation, and human supervision to detect and block bots. It features a community voting system, personalized blocklists, and hierarchical verification to reduce false positives. By integrating advanced technology with collective intelligence, Bot Blocker aims to create a safer, more authentic online environment across multiple social networks.
